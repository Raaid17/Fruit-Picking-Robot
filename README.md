# Fruit-Picking-Robot
This is repo for the fruit picking robot robotic arm. Using this code we can control the robotic arm using coordinates xyz or manually for each joint.
# REMINDER! PLEASE READ! /n
1.Dont directly power the esp32 board to the battery. Use a regulates power supply like a power bank. Recomendded 5V 3A. /n
2. You can power the PCM96845 Servo Module directly to the battery or use voltage regulator for safety. It can handle up to 16V on the side pin. DO NOT POWER IT THROUGH PIN THAT IS PARALLEL WITH OTHER PIN!!! /n
3. The servos need at least 5V to move./n
